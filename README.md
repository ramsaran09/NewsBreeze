TECHSTACK:
* This app is developed in Kotlin
* I used MVVM architecture to develop the app (androidx lifecycle components)
* Coroutines for async programming
* Retrofit for networking.
* Koin for dependency injection
* Glide and picasso for image loading
* Shared preferences for local storage
* I have also utilized Kotlin's extension functions, sealed classes, etc., for efficiency.
